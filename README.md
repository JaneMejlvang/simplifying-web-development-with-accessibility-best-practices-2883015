Too often in the world of web development, accessibility is given a low level of priority in the development stage of a site and is often relegated to experts for later implementation. But why spend the time and money hiring an outside consultant when you can set up a website for proper accessibility at the build stage? In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows the benefits of taking this approach, and how simple it is to do so. As Morten explains, all thatâ€™s needed is a basic understanding of why these elements are so important, how they work, and how good coding practices and modern web standards can get you there with little extra work. He tackles accessibility from all sides, starting with the origins of some of the most common accessibility issues and how to address them, then covers key topics like accessible design, hiding and showing visual content, handling graphics and media, and the semantic elements that can help make your designs more accessible.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing

The exercise files are stand-alone examples in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You do not need any additional software to run them, and you are free to copy the code and use it in your own projects.
